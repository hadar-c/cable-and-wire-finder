# cable_and_wire_finder
In this project we deal with images that have cables and wires in different shapes,
different sizes, colors and extremely challenging shapes,
in order to train our networks we use a ready-made database that consists of two images as follows:

Eventually after the networks learn they will have to get an image that has a thread in a certain shape 
and make a mask on the image so that the thread will be white and the background black,
basically from some number of departments to convert to 2 departments.
The dataset is first processed and changed, which enables the learning process,
such as making a change to the image size.
See results.
